Deadpool and wolverine became the highest grossing R-rated movie of all time and easy to say a lot of people loved that movie and ranked it as best MCU movie since 'Endgame' but this title is given to a lot of MCU movies including spiderman no way home and shangch so saying any MCU movie is best since endgame is not a huge feat especially considering the fact that MCU movies since endgame has been either boring or had wasted potential or just plain bad. The question one might ask is that will Deadpool and wolverine suffer the same faith that spiderman no way home did? Alot of people who loved spiderman no way home soon turned on it after the recency baiseness ended and there was no one to cheer for Tobey Maguire at home, so what about DP3? Will it suffer the same faith? Well it somewhat looks like it.

## The Plot of DP3:

Ryan Reynolds has gotten a lot of backlash due to whole it ends with us drama and because of that the fever of Reynolds have decreased but comedy sells even after the cameos are leaked and that's one thing DP3 has that spiderman nwh didn't although nwh, had a marvelous ending to support it. DP3 though is no way near nwh. The movie simply has a B- plot which tries to enhance the lore of MCU multiverse by introducing the role of anchor but it doesn't work and the whole timeline doesn't make sense for DP3, it confusing and hurts MCU multiverse saga and rules, sure the comedy works and works really well but the whole midlife crisis for a Deadpool movie is no show and considering the fact that Deadpool makes fun of those stereotypes of superhero and does the same thing is enough to know Deadpool movies are not some revolutionary movies some people ought to think they are, yes they have fourth wall breaking and yes they can be funny and ironic but the biggest irony is the fact that they have no answer for all the things they call out other superhero movies and use those stereotypes like every movie.

## The Other guy:

That being said Deadpool and wolverine does have something more then just a B- plot with Reynolds' signature style comedy. It had THE WOLVERINE. Hugh Jackman returns once again after saying goodbye to the character in 2017 for a hefty pay check. Daniel Craig and Jackman have something in common, and no it is not that they both have auditioned for James bond rather it is saying goodbye to their iconic character like a billion times and then coming back once again. There is no doubt that Jackman has brought wolverine to life, he is the soul of fox's X-Men and is somewhat the reason why fox's X-Men lasted for such a long time but in all honesty, wolverine coming back just was of no need. Yes it was great to see Reynolds and Jackman together but it sort of ruins the ending of the masterpiece which is Logan of 2017. When the movie came defenders of the movie said that MCU isn't interfering with that ending, it is a different wolverine and yes it is a different wolverine who basically acts like post X-Men 3 wolverine, it is kind of what the flash tv show did with harry well of earth 2 and that's a CW show. Plus the wolverine dying was not a goodbye to a certain wolverine it was a goodbye to Jackman's wolverine and that an era has ended. Jackman coming back just because it will be 'cool' to have dp and wolverine together hinders the whole Logan movie and also effects the MCU wolverine. It had been 7 years since Logan and with a couple of more years the impact of Jackman's wolverine would have been neutralized due to a new generation and it would have been perfect to have a new wolverine but with Jackman coming back MCU has chosen reverse instead of 2nd or 3rd gear but Jackman isn't the only person they brought back.

## Obsession of MCU:

Speaking of reverse gear, MCU brought cameos again. I thought c in MCU meant cinematic but it turns out it means cameos. The movie had cameos and used the excuse as it was a goodbye note for the fox's X-Men universe but had the cameos of those people which had zero impact on fox's universe to begin with, there was no need of all those cameos, it was fun the first time when they did cameos in NWH but was a sh\*t show ever since.

## The confusing villains:

There is no denying that DP3 villains were the worst thing of the movie, both of the actors are top tier Emmy winners and are just given nothing much to work with, which is somewhG shocking when one realizes how many writers the movies has but let's be honest all of the writers had one job only which is to make sure that movie is 'funny'

## Conclusion

So the question about Deadpool 3 having the same faith as NWH has a simple answer, sooner or later there would be a realization that movie was mid at best and was over hyped because of 2 iconic characters coming to screen and just like NWH, the plot holes of the movies would be exposed.
